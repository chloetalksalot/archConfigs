This is a spotify display made for the native spotify client, you can get it here:
https://www.spotify.com/us/download/previews/

It will also need python and python-dbus in order to be able to get which song is playing so make sure that is installed.
In ubuntu run:
sudo apt-get install python python-dbus

There are two fonts that you need to download:
http://www.dafont.com/ll-record.font (for the play symbol)
http://www.dafont.com/roboto.font (for the text)

For the files, rename the "conkyrc" to ".conkyrc" and place it in your home directory.
Place the spotify-display folder inside a ".conky" folder in your home directory.
